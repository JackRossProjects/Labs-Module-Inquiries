What technical choices did you make today?<br>
Today DS chose to measure text complexity with TextStat (setting our threshold to the complexity of 12 year olds - SH age cap)
We chose to use ModerateContent to ensure any text or picture submissions that are offensive aren’t seen by our users
We decided to use FastAPI instead of flask for our machine learning application

Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?
Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.<br>
I think the decision to use TextStat to measure writing complexity instead of building our own model was a good one. It will help us ensure our machine learning will actually be implemented but also more accurate than something we could build ourselves.
The second is using ModerateContent and for the same reasons as above. This is about honing our skills as data scientists but more importantly it is to make sure this product can deliver. If we allow images of obscene things to get through to our users (children) then we have not delivered.
In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.
I made the choices above because I want this product to be as good as it can be. It would be good experience to build the models from scratch but I’d argue it’s better experience to work with cutting edge frameworks and have a product worth using.

Extracting useful conclusions from your process:
According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?<br>
A good technical choice is one that everyone working with can understand, something you can actually implement into a front end/API, and a good technical choice should have reasons for being selected over another.

## Questions

Q1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?

Q2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.

Q3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    
Q4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently?
   - What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
   
  
A1. 
Release 1 - will the client have metrics involved ? Quiz/rating/reading comprehension after reading the stories? (prior to release 3)

Authentication ? okta ? 
Roles ? parent account , child account.

How will UGC be managed, for example will there be administrator roles that screen content for abuse? If so are those roles also expected to be incorporated in the 1&2nd releases ?

DS : scan illustrations ? transcribe ? discard handwritten image ?

How are we measuring complexity ?
Does the SH have a specific method/metric for measuring UGCâ€™s complexity and rank?

Handling misspellings and bad grammar ?
Is there a specific method that the SH would like to focus on for handling grammatical/spelling errors?
E.g topic modeling/ POS tagging to analyze grammar

spell - correct ? speech tagging ? 
Options if the SH doesn't have a specific answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13928155/spell-checker-for-python

Transcribe the user's (child) stories into text.


A3.
Transcribe the user's (child) stories into text.
- Figuring out how to transcribe a childs handwriting is going to be a very interesting challenge. Margin for error compared to adult handwriting
  will have to be much higher and the training data might even have to be labeled by hand in certain cases. 
  
 
A4.
Categorization.
Putting things into categories has sped up the process so much. From different types of users to different funciton calls for different actions.
Knowing what you're dealing with and how the pieces are differnt is so helpful when creating user stories.
